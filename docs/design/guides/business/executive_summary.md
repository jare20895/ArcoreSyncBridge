# Executive Summary

## Problem statement
Teams need SharePoint and Teams lists for collaboration, but their system of record lives in PostgreSQL. Dataverse for Teams is limited and does not meet data scale or governance requirements.

## Solution
Arcore SyncBridge provides a secure middleware that synchronizes Postgres data into SharePoint lists. It offers a catalog UI, configuration workflows, and a durable sync ledger.

## Strategic value
- Faster adoption of SharePoint as a UI layer without migrating core data.
- Reduced manual export/import processes.
- Improved auditability and compliance controls.
